## Adaptive RAG Workflow
The **Adaptive RAG workflow** intelligently determines the best source for answering user questions:

1. **Question Analysis**: Determine best route â€“ `vectorstore`, `web`, or `LLM`.  
   - Vectorstore: Most resume-related queries (skills, projects, experience, job fit).  
   - Web: Recent trends or external context.  
   - LLM: General questions, greetings, or fallback queries.  

2. **Vectorstore Path**
   - Expand the query for multiple perspectives.  
   - Retrieve documents for both original and expanded queries.  
   - Generate answer using unique retrieved documents.  
   - Grade the generation and decide whether to use it, regenerate, or fallback to web search.
   ```python
   # Map graded result to workflow path
   if graded.binary_score.lower() == "yes" and graded.hallucination.lower() == "no":
       return "useful"
   elif graded.binary_score.lower() == "yes" and graded.hallucination.lower() == "yes":
       return "not supported"
   else:
       return "not useful"
    ```

3. **Web Search Path**
   - Use **Tavily** to fetch contextual information.  
   - Pass context to LLM to generate enhanced answers.  

4. **LLM Path**
   - For general questions, greetings, or explanations.
